# LoRA-SAM-for-damage-detection
This is a repo for paper of "Sam-Based Instance Segmentation Models for the Automation of Structural Damage Detection" https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4750668  

The model is built on the MMDetection framework.   

We have uploaded different model files and configuration files. They need to be run based on MMDetection. The code is modified from [RSPrompter](https://github.com/KyanChen/RSPrompter), which you can refer to first. And here, we would like to thank Chen for their support.  

You can find the dataset here https://universe.roboflow.com/uni-of-birmingham/masonry
